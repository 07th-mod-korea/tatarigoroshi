# PS3 Voice and Graphics Patch (in progress)

Currently hosting only the automated placed lines. All files need manual fixing, avoid placing them on your game.

**Switch to the developer's branch for script progress.**


README's going to be updated as the patch is developed. Refer to [Onikakushi](https://github.com/higurashi-mod/onikakushi) for more details about the patch.

Old collaborators welcome to join the repository, however it's still preferred to fork the repository and update through pull requests.
